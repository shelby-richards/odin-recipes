    <h1>Turkish Red Lentil Soup with Mint</h1>
    <img src="../images/lentil.jpg" alt="Lentil soup with mint">
    <p>This soup is divine and much like you will get at any authentic Turkish restaurant. It has dynamic flavors and a lovely mild heat. I make a big batch and eat it for lunch with crusty bread and salad the entire week. Optional: Serve with additional mint and lemon wedges.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
        <li>1/2 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced </li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced tomatoes, drained </li>
        <li>5 cups chicken stock </li>
        <li>1/2 cup red lentils </li>
        <li>1/4 cup fine bulgur </li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional) </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried mint </li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat. Cook and stir the onion in the hot oil until it begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir the garlic into the onion and cook another 2 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes to the onion mixture; continue to cook and stir another 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken stock, red lentils, bulgur, rice, tomato paste, paprika, cayenne pepper, and mint to the tomato mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Bring the soup to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the the lentils and rice are cooked through, about 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Pour the soup into a blender to no more than half full. Firmly hold the lid in place and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth; pour into your serving dish. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup in cooking pot. </li>
